# crud_app
A (very) basic CRUD application using java, maven, spring boot, and docker.

# Overview
A small project to get some exposure to Docker, Spring+Maven, and working RESTfully. Currently there is no 'front end' to this application, so if you wish to interact with the db, you'll need to send your own PUT/GET/POST/DELETE requests (I recommend an application like Postman)
